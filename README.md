These scripts document how to produce all figures in a recently submitted manuscript 'Positive and negative feedbacks to Antarctic ice shelf melt in an eddy rich global ocean--sea-ice model' (submitted to Journal of Climate, November 2019). 
Scripts required to compute statistics quoted in the manuscript are also included.
This work was conducted on Australia's National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra and the provided scripts utilise tools from the cosima-cookbook project (https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-cookbook), xarray, and dask.
All model output used is stored on cosima's hh5 project on the NCI. A subset will be made available at the cosima doi.
